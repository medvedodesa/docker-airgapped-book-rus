# NOTES:
# 
# Adjustments based on RAM:
# - 8GB RAM:  shared_buffers=1GB, effective_cache_size=3GB
# - 16GB RAM: shared_buffers=2GB, effective_cache_size=6GB
# - 32GB RAM: shared_buffers=4GB, effective_cache_size=12GB
#
# Adjustments based on workload:
# - High read:  increase effective_cache_size
# - High write: increase wal_buffers, checkpoint_timeout
# - Many connections: increase max_connections, adjust work_mem down
#
# Monitor with:
# - pg_stat_activity (active queries)
# - pg_stat_database (database stats)
# - pg_stat_user_tables (table statistics)
