# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to risk-assessment.csv
# 2. Import into spreadsheet software
# 3. Customize threats for your environment
# 4. Update likelihood/impact based on your controls
# 5. Track mitigation progress
# 6. Review and update quarterly

# Risk Scoring Guide:
# 
# Likelihood:
# 1 - Low: Unlikely to occur (< 10% chance)
# 2 - Medium: Possible to occur (10-50% chance)
# 3 - High: Likely to occur (> 50% chance)
#
# Impact:
# 1 - Low: Minimal impact (minor disruption, no data loss)
# 2 - Medium: Moderate impact (temporary outage, limited data exposure)
# 3 - High: Significant impact (extended outage, data breach)
# 4 - Critical: Severe impact (complete compromise, regulatory penalties)
#
# Risk Score Interpretation:
# 1-2: Low Risk (Accept)
# 3-4: Medium-Low Risk (Monitor)
# 6-8: High Risk (Mitigate within 90 days)
# 9-12: Critical Risk (Immediate action required)

# Mitigation Status:
# Not Started - Not yet begun
# Planned - Scheduled with date
# In Progress - Currently implementing
# Complete - Fully implemented
# Ongoing - Continuous process

# Review Schedule:
# - Weekly: Update status for active mitigations
# - Monthly: Review high/critical risks
# - Quarterly: Full risk assessment review
# - Annually: Complete threat model update
